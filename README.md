there is a bridge over river joining two islands in north and south and named as such. at once only one person can travel across the bridge, so farmers are expected to stand in queue to access this resource limitation. the farmers once cross the bridge are destined to comeback and  continuously move back and forth to trade the supplies with the villagers in other side. this program tries to replicate the scenario using semaphores how such longevity in action can be attained.
